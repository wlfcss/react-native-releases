### Removed: features that have been removed; these are breaking

- Remove TimerMixin from ListView ([8ceb158](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/8ceb1586ee596a1bdf44bbb8e4c6ab54cbaa7c8b) by [@exced](https://github.com/exced))

### Known issues

There are a few issues that don't have a finalized solution (as it happens for 0.x projects). In particular:

- when using Xcode 10 and `react-native init`, your build may fail due to third-party build steps ([#20774](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/20774)). There is a [commit](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/b44c5ae92eb08125d466cf151cb804dabfbbc690) we are planning to cherry pick in a future release that should help - in the meantime, you should be able to run these commands from the project folder to fix the issue (you should need to do it only once per project):

  ```bash
  cd node_modules/react-native
  scripts/ios-install-third-party.sh
  cd third-party/glog-0.3.5/
  ../../scripts/ios-configure-glog.sh
  ```

- React `16.6.0` works for the most part, aside from the Context API (check [this issue](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/21975)) - and if you are eager to test the new React Hooks you will have to be patient, as they are not production ready and `16.7.alpha` is **not** yet [supported](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/21967) by React Native.

## [0.57.3]

**NOTE WELL**: when you upgrade to this version you **NEED** to upgrade `react` and `react-test-renderer` to version `"16.6.0-alpha.8af6728"`. Also, please check the *Known issues* section below, especially if you are using Xcode 10.

## [0.57]

Welcome to the 0.57 release of React Native! This release addresses a number of issues and has some exciting improvements. We again skipped a monthly release, focused on quality by extending the release candidate phase, and let some upstream packages reach stable for inclusion.

This release includes [599 commits by 73 different contributors](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/compare/0.56-stable...0.57-stable)! In response to feedback, we've prepared a changelog that contains only user-impacting changes. Please share your input and let us know how we can make this even more useful, and as always [let us know](https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-releases/issues/34) if you have any feedback on this process.

### Highlights

#### New features

- Accessibility APIs now support accessibility hints, inverted colors, and easier usage of defining the element's role and states; read more at [@ziqichen6's excellent blog post](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/blog/2018/08/13/react-native-accessibility-updates)
- On iOS, `WKWebView` can now be used within the `WebView` component; read more at [@rsnara's awesome blog post](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/blog/2018/08/27/wkwebview)
- Better support for out-of-tree platforms. For details, please refer to [the discussion](https://github.com/react-native-community/discussions-and-proposals/issues/21) that the community used to get this up and running (there will be a new page in the docs dedicated to it too) - huge props to @empyrical for working on this!

#### Tooling updates

- Android tooling has been updated to match newer configuration requirements (SDK 27, gradle 4.4, and support library 27); building with Android plugin 3.2 doesn't work due to the gradle scripts, so **please** stay on Android Studio 3.1 for now
- Support Babel 7 stable landed! Be sure to read [here](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/typescript/2018/08/27/typescript-and-babel-7/) about using TypeScript and check out the [Babel 7 migration guide](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/next/v7-migration) for help migrating.
- Metro has been upgraded (with Babel 7 and better transformer support), and in the next major release we plan on having two new features (ram bundles and inline requires) optional for you all to use - you can read how it will happen [here](https://github.com/react-native-community/discussions-and-proposals/blob/master/core-meetings/2018-09-metro-meeting.md); moreover, if you have a custom packager config, we recommend you read also the "updating to this version" section.
- Flow, React, and related packages have also been updated; this includes [working support](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/cf5f3e97eb68c5bcf1d9f27261795d0221e27be4) for the [React Profiler](https://reactjs.org/blog/2018/09/10/introducing-the-react-profiler.html).

#### The Slimmening is happening

As mentioned a few times in the past, the core team is reviewing the repository to trim it to the base React Native features in order to make the whole ecosystem more maintainable (by using a *divide-et-impera* approach, the community will move faster and enable pull requests to be reviewed and merged quicker). This change requires extracting some components into their own separate repos and removing old, unused code ([details here](https://github.com/react-native-community/discussions-and-proposals/issues/6)).

0.57 is **not** directly affected by any changes, but we want you to know that:

- `WebView` will be moved to its own repo at [react-native-community/react-native-webview](https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-webview). There is already a base implementation there. Help us out by giving that a try, and expect that `WebView` will be deprecated soon
- `NavigatorIOS` will be **fully** removed from the main codebase starting 0.58.0 (via [this commit](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/0df92afc1caf96100013935d50bdde359b688658)); it is now deprecated

### Updating to this version

1. Upgrade the version of React Native in the `package.json` from `0.56.0` to `0.57.0`, and the React version to `16.5`
2. Change the babel-preset dependency from `"babel-preset-react-native": "^5",` to `"metro-react-native-babel-preset": "^0.45.0",`, then change the `.babelrc` configuration to:

   ```JSON
     {
       "presets": ["module:metro-react-native-babel-preset"]
     }
   ```

3. Ensure that you have all the babel dependencies to version `^7.0.0` (you may also need to add `"babel-core": "7.0.0-bridge.0"` as a yarn resolution to ensure retro-compatibility)
4. If you have a custom packager configuration via `rn-cli.config.js`, you probably need to update it to work with the updated Metro configuration structure (for full detail refer to Metro's [documentation](https://facebook.github.io/metro/docs/en/configuration)); here are some commonly encountered changes to `rn-cli.config.js`:

   ```diff
   -const blacklist = require('metro/src/blacklist')
   +const blacklist = require('metro-config/src/defaults/blacklist')

   // ...

   module.exports = {
   +  watchFolders: alternateRoots,
   +  resolver: {
   +    blacklistRE: blacklist
   +  },
   +  transformer: {
   +    babelTransformerPath: require.resolve('./scripts/transformer.js'),
   +  },
   -  getProjectRoots() {
   -    return [
   -      path.resolve(__dirname),
   -    ].concat(alternateRoots)
   -  },
   -  getBlacklistRE() {
   -    return blacklist;
   -  },
   -  transformModulePath: require.resolve('./scripts/transformer.js'),
   }
   ```

5. Run `yarn` to ensure that all the new dependencies have been installed

### Removed: features that have been removed; these are breaking

- *[BREAKING]* Removed `ScrollView.propTypes`; use flow or typescript for verifying correct prop usage instead ([5b6ff01](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/5b6ff01) by [@sahrens](https://github.com/sahrens))

#### Android specific removals

- `ReactInstancePackage` is now deprecated; use `@link ReactPackage` or `@link LazyReactPackage` ([b938cd5](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/b938cd5) by [@axe-fb](https://github.com/axe-fb))

## [0.56]

Welcome to the June 2018 release of React Native!
Over 60 contributors made [816 commits](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/compare/0.55-stable...0.56-stable) since March - and we are extremely grateful to every single one of you.

As you'll see in a second, this new version has some important **breaking changes** that required a lot of extra efforts to bring to a stable 0.56. This was the main reason behind skipping April and May from the monthly release cycle, but looking forward we are planning on going back to do a rollout every month.

### Highlights

#### React Native now uses **Babel 7**

When upgrading to 0.56, make sure to bump your `babel-preset-react-native` `package.json` dependency to `5.0.2` or newer (but still as *fixed* value).

React Native library authors will need to update their libraries to make use of the updated Babel preset as Babel 7 is **not** backwards compatible.

If you have issues upgrading to Babel 7, please double check the [related documentation](https://new.babeljs.io/docs/en/next/v7-migration.html#versioning-dependencies-blog-2017-12-27-nearing-the-70-releasehtml-peer-dependencies-integrations), in particular the sections related to _Package Renames_ and _Scoped Packages_.

The [`babel-bridge`](https://github.com/babel/babel-bridge) library may be used if you need to use libraries that have not yet upgraded to Babel 7. You may also enforce the Babel 7 dependency via tools like [yarn resolutions](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/selective-version-resolutions/). Overall, you need to ensure all the `@babel/*` deps are fixed at version `7.0.0-beta.47`.

#### **Node 8** is now the minimum required version

Trailing commas are now allowed.

#### **iOS 9** is now the minimum required version

Any device that can run iOS 8, can upgrade to iOS 9. Developers who support iOS 8 in their apps may continue doing so as this is a Xcode-level setting (`IPHONEOS_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET`).

#### **Xcode 9** is now the minimum required version

We recommend using Xcode 9.4 as that is what we use to run our tests.

#### **Android** projects are now compiled using the _Android 26 SDK_

The target API level is left unchanged in this release.

Starting August 2018, new apps submitted to the Play Store will need to target API 26 as a minimum. You can now opt your project in to use API 26 (or newer) as the target. Please let us know about any issues, as we'd like to finalize support for Android API 26 by the time `0.57.0` is released.

#### `WebView` will only load http(s) URLs by default

Geolocation is disabled by default.

#### Flow improvements, migrating away from PropTypes

Added Flow types for several components.

We're migrating away from PropTypes and runtime checks and instead relying on **Flow**. You'll notice many improvements related to Flow in this release.

- Fix project settings warnings on newer Xcode versions, remove unnecessary console logging.
- Modernized `YellowBox`.
  Sort warnings by recency, group warnings by format string, present stack traces, show status of loading source maps, support inspecting each occurrence of a warning, and bug fixes.
- Prettier files!
- Lots of bug fixes.

#### State of React Native

Heads-up: the Facebook internal team is [currently working on a rewrite of some core architecture pieces](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/blog/2018/06/14/state-of-react-native-2018). This is a **work in progress** and we do not expect it to be ready for use in open source quite yet, but we felt the need to let you know what those commits mentioning Fabric are about.

### Known issues

During the RC testing of this version, a few issues that have been opened don't have yet a finalized solution ( [19827](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/19827), [19763](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/19763), [19859](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/19859), [19955](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/19955) ).

So please check the already opened issues before submitting new ones.

If you are using Windows to develop React Native apps, we suggest you keep an eye on [this issue in particular](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/19953) since there have been many reports of issues related to Win 10 and RN 0.56.

## [0.54]

Welcome to the February 2018 release of React Native! This release includes work done by the React Native team and the community in January, and there are some big changes here after the holidays. Thanks for 270 commits from 87 contributors, you all are great! Here are a few highlights from the release:

- Long awaited **Blob** changes: upload, download, fetch locally, and more
- Sticky headers now work on inverted Lists
- Update to the newest React, which deprecated some lifecycle methods and added new ones – expect Yellowbox until React Native is updated
- `Space-evenly` is now there (sorry for the confusion with 0.52's release notes)
- A lot of under-the-covers work on Yoga, iOS's **Text** and **TextInput**, and a ton of other areas
- Multiple crash fixes

The changelog is arranged by the customary added, removed, changed, and fixed plus internal; the changes are also organized by platform.
